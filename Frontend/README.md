I've added several boundary conditions and business rules that create clear test partitions:

Quantity Boundaries:

Minimum: 1 item
Maximum: 5 items per product
Invalid: 0 or negative quantities


Cart Limitations:

Maximum 10 total items in cart
Cannot exceed available stock
Cannot add out-of-stock items


Order Amount Boundaries:

Minimum order: $10
Maximum order: $1000


Stock Level Partitions:

Out of stock (0)
Low stock (1-5)
Normal stock (>5)


Input Validation:

Quantity must be numeric
Quantity must be within bounds
Stock level checks



These modifications create several clear equivalence partitions for testing:

Valid Partitions:

Adding items within stock limits
Updating quantities within bounds
Orders within price range
Normal stock levels


Invalid Partitions:

Negative quantities
Zero quantities
Quantities exceeding stock
Quantities exceeding per-item limit
Orders below minimum amount
Orders above maximum amount
Out of stock items
